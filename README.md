### 1. Extended Data Figures, Results, and Methods

Several supplemental data figures, results, and explanations of methodology can be found in additional files hosted on Dropbox.
They can be found in the `supplemental-data` folder in the following link:  
https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/5ojghapoyaaua8q4oqmmi/ACat2UowmxcQjYl2Y8XMHAw?rlkey=06ez1w18q7isv45jy0pg9uygz&st=fa7tdhmp&dl=0

### 2. Data and Code Used to Reproduce Manuscript Figures and Results

Reproduction of figures and results from the manuscript can be found in the `results` folder of the same Dropbox link.
Inside the folder are HTML files that can be opened in any web browser; they will have all information neccessary to view the figues and the code used to produce them.

### 3. Further Analysis

Beyond here is information for reproducing or performing your own analysis.
As in the Quick Start, visit the Dropbox link, this time downloading both `raw-data` and `results`.
These should both be placed in a directory called `storage` and placed in the top-level of this project after downloading it from Github.
Note that the project structure currently assumes a Unix environment as there are the top-level symbolic links `data` and `results` pointing to those respective directories within `storage`.
These may have to be recreated on non-Unix systems such as Windows.

We provide two methods below for setting up an analysis environment and running the code.
Alternatively, a user may wish to use their own R install and packages, however this approach may require troubleshooting and does not guarantee reproduction of our results.

#### A. Docker

Docker is virtualisation software that allows the distribution of reproducible operating system environments, including userland software like R packages.
See here to install and set up Docker [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/).
Once installed, the simplest option is to run `run_all.R` using the command below:

```
docker-compose up all
```

This will compile all R Markdown files non-interactively, replacing the existing files in the `results` dir and creating a `tmp` dir containing intermediate data objects.

For more in-depth exploration, RStudio Server is provided within the Docker image and can readily be accessed through a web browser either on one's local machine or through a remote server.
To get started, first create a `.env` file with the port that RStudio should connect to, as below:

```
PORT=8787
```

Any available port can be used and ports in the 8000 range are generally always open.
More details can be found at [https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker).

RStudio Server can then be started by running:

```
docker-compose up rstudio
```

You can then visit `http://localhost:8787/` in a web browser to use RStudio.

If one wants to run RStudio Server on a remote machine, it can be accessed through a local web browser by first running an SSH tunnel like below:

```
ssh -N -L 8787:localhost:8787 user@ip-address
```

The left-most port specifies the port desired locally, whereas the right-most is the port on the server.
The right-most argument is the user@ip-address details used to log into the server.
Once connected, visit `http://localhost:8787/` as before, assuming 8787 is the local port in the tunnel.
More details can be found here: [https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/post/run-rstudio-server-with-singularity-on-hpc/](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/post/run-rstudio-server-with-singularity-on-hpc/).

#### B. Apptainer

Apptainer (previously named Singularity) is similar to Docker except with a different security structure that makes it easier to integrate with high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.
Installation instructions can be found at [https://apptainer.org/](https://apptainer.org/).
Similar to before, `run_all.R` is called with:

```
sh ./apptainer.sh all
```

To use RStudio, no `.env` file is needed, it is instead included in the command:

```
sh ./apptainer.sh rstudio 8787
```

In the same way as using Docker, RStudio Server will be accessible through a local web browser on localhost at the desired port.
An SSH tunnel can also be identically configured for accessing remote servers.
